I took a scheduled break 'intermission' for Game-A-Week for this week so I can focus on studying for some final exams the coming week. Nothing much else to say. Some of the studying I did did result in some projects that I can post, mostly graph visualization stuff for the generation of Mininium Spanning Trees and stuff like that. Simple, undergrad level coding. I may clean them up and post them in the near future, with support for serializing the graphs. I also made some progress on a browser based turn-based combat system, but I would write about that more once its finished its milestone

I did make another two simple pull request for OpenLibrary [here](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/pull/8524) and [here](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/pull/8513)

Otherwise. It's a simple week. Kind of a breather. Next week I will be resuming Game-A-Week again and doing that for another five weeks in a row, before moving onto making a game in a two week deadline. Then after ten more weeks of that, we can make a game in a one month deadline.
