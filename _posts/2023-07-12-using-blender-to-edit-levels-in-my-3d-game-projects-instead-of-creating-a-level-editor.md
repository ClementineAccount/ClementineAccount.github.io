In late April 2023, I started working on a [video game where the player could fly an aircraft vehicle around an open 3D space](https://github.com/ClementineAccount/Albuquerque/tree/main). The main appeal and challenge to me was creating it without a game engine and editor to support me. So instead of using a popular game engine like Unity or Unreal, I would be writing a lot of the code myself for instead coding a lot of features myself as a learning exercise and for fun.

For some brief context in layman's terms, game engines and editors are to video game development as what 'Adobe's Photoshop' would be towards manipulating photographs of making digital artwork or what Microsoft Office or Google Documents would be for making paperwork, essays or documents. They are industry standard tools that help standarize and make the process of game development more productive by covering problems that are already solved. 

My decision to not use such a game engine for this project puts me into situations that allow me to attempt to solve these problems on my own, which provides a good educational outlet for developing my skills. One such challenge that can be taken for granted from these editors is being able to design the levels in the 3D space directly.

In contrast, my game is developed entirely in code as shown in the screenshot which shows my codebase opened in [Microsoft Visual Studios](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/). I don't have any preview of the game world through an editor would need to write my own code to add those features myself.
