Hi! So I finished this week's game, can read about it [here](https://clementineaccount.github.io/posts/gaw5/). It was fun to make and to play. This week I am taking a break from making a game every week in order to focus on revisiting some past ideas and starting some non game-jam projects. One of the ideas I want to [revisit is the turn-based combat stuff from week 3](https://clementineaccount.github.io/posts/gaw3/) as I want to expand on that combat system, fix up the spaghetti code, and allow a user to create custom enemy behaviors and stats using JSON.

Regarding last week's post, [my pull request for OpenLibrary got accepted](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/pull/8490) so I am happy about that progression. I am also taking on [this issue](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/issues/8492). One thing I learned from OpenLibrary is how they [attach debuggers for Python in Docker Containers](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/wiki/Debugging-and-Performance-Profiling). I also got more comfortable working in Docker stuff and Python for the web in general too. The next issue I am working on is a bit tricky, as I have to understand how 'render templates' work and how they can affect what kind of button shows up on a webpage. It's interesting having to figure out the logic flow for a program by observation, stack traces with breakpoints and educated guesses.
