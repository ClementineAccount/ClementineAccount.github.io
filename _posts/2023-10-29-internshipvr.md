In early 2020, before I started undergrad, I worked on an internship contract project for Nanyang Technological University. 

In this contract, I worked in Unity using both SteamVR and the Oculus extensions to script a roleplay simulation for a study. This is the project listed on my LinkedIn as well. 

The original study, which also contains more details on what the simulation scenario in virtual reality, can be read here, titled: [The Effect of VR Avatar Embodiment on Improving Attitudes and Closeness Toward Immigrants](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8554103/), where I am also credited. 

The internship program was part of my pre-university education at Nanyang Polytechnic. I was able to create the scenario and script the interactions with the assets given to me to fit the proposals given. It was my first time working professionally, using Unity to fufill requirements. I remembered that I was able to adapt quickly and understand the various extensions and plugins that the project had, such as the Inverse Kinematic plugin and so on. I was able to adjust and change the simulation with feedback over many iterations, modifying the same scenes over and over to client specifications, without much issue. 

I also had to improvise and learn on the fly how to debug scenarios inside a VR program, creating various internal tools and settings in order to test the different configurations of event flags needed, to catch bugs and other glitches. In the end, the simulation that was scripted by me was able to perform the study without issues.
