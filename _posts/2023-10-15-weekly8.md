I chose to change the scope of the Halloween Game, focusing on releasing it for free at a later date on Itch.io rather than on Steam. One of the reasons for this is because of poor internal playtesting feedback. By scoping down, I can still use what I had created for a fun and small side project with more creative liberty, as we do not have to consider a market perspective.

Despite this change of plans, I felt I had still learned a lot from the two weeks of development targeting Steam. I was able to get comfortable with Steamworks development features such as the store page editor and the [Depots](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application/depots) feature, which lets you upload and update game builds. I also gained an understanding over how Steam's tagging system worked, matching your game to related ones.

The following are some of the capsule artwork and description I had made before scrapping the Steam release. I will focus on doing a Steam release on October 2024 instead with a different game, and focus on building my skills up to that point in the meantime.

# Game A Week

I also decided that I should be focusing more on [making even smaller games every week](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/game-a-week-getting-experienced-at-failure) to further build up my skill, before slowly working my way up to bigger scoped games every month and then a game every three months.

You can read more about the game I had finished this week [here](https://clementineaccount.github.io/posts/gaw1/). I detail some reflections and context there too. 

## Other Stuff

Beyond 'Game A Week', I have some other side projects I am considering. Not going to say too much before they are done though, other than that I want to experiment with WebGL 3D stuff. Something like the [Sims build mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sims) where you can build and decorate a simple house in your browser... which is something I always wanted to play myself. No gameplay loop so its not really a 'game' though.

I also still need to write the retrospectives and post-mortems for two of my undergraduate capstone projects. One was a 2D card game I had worked on in a small team as a sophomore, and the other was a 3D driving game as a junior.

I have been putting them off because they aren't that interesting to me while not being that recent, but in hindsight there were many interesting things that I learned since then. I might as well complete posts on them for completeness sake.
