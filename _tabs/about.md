# Who am you? What is this site? What are your goals?

My name is Clementine, I was born in 1999 and I live in Singapore. I use this blog at least once a week to share my retrospective on the projects I have completed that week or occassionally things that I have learned that could be useful for others.

My current focus is on 'Game A Week' where I finish a playable video game prototype every week, which includes a full gameplay loop. I focus on making games that are playable with only the mouse or one hand, with an emphasis on tactical based challenges rather than anything that rely on reflexes or timing.

Beyond writing about my projects or things I learned relating to developing software, I tend to be a more 'private' person when it comes to an online presence and so I don't tend to write about my personal life in this blog.
