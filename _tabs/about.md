# Who am you? What is this site? What are your goals?

My name is Clementine and I was born in 1999. This blog originally started as a way to write about my coding projects as a computer science undergraduate, but have since evolved to be focused on my indie game development business. My posts won't bore you with trivial dev logs, and I aim to try and have every post I write here give some advice or value that you can learn from.

My promise to my players is to release one full, finished game every single month and catalog the experiences and lessons learned from these games so that they could apply them themselves for their own projects... or just for their own entertainment. 

My primary goal as a business is to sell small but high quality 'point and click' focused games on a lower budget as a way to supplement my main income sources, with the target of making an average of a humble 1000 USD a month through sales of my back catalog. I am not aiming to release hits here, but to cater to niche audiences, with an emphasis on having [middle games](https://howtomarketagame.com/2023/09/28/the-missing-middle-in-game-development/) that run well on low-end hardware. By 'point and click' focused, I am referring to accessible games that can be played entirely with a mouse or touchscreen, with keyboard controls only serving as optional helpful hotkeys rather than reflex heavy controls.


# What kind of games do you make?

The target demographic for future games being made starting from November 2023 will be focused primarily on having a horror aesthetic but with the gameplay loops of [Tactics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn-based_tactics) or Strategy genre games. The combination of horror and tactical games is rarer, but I think there is a hungry audience for it (including myself!) that would devour them. Of course, I am experimenting with both turn-based and real-time tactical type games.

I chose the genre of Tactical and Strategy focused games after careful market study and with the consideration of my budget, resources and interests. The amount of polish, quality and accessibility I could deliver in a month of development is much higher for games with a focus on 'point and click' interfaces compared to reflex heavy action mechanics. This genre benefits from being possible to playtest and balance using just pen and paper while inherently allowing a greater degree of abstraction in art assets and animations. 

Not only that, but it is also a more underserved consumer market, espeically when incorporating horror aesthetic and themes, which allows a greater degree of creative innovation and freedom. There are not many tactics games coming out that are made with a more experimental and smaller budget.

Why the horror genre in particular? Honestly part of it is that I just love making scary stuff at its core. Marketing wise, however, horror is a very viable market that allows the creation of high quality, expressive games with a very low budget as detailed in this [article by zukalous](https://howtomarketagame.com/2023/10/02/every-indie-game-developer-should-make-a-horror-game/). It is also an aesthetic that I genuinely love to draw in as someone who does not have a professional or educational background in art. When it comes to aesthetics, horror as a genre embraces a more raw artistic expression and soul rather than corporate, professional and clean polish when it comes to marketing and the quality of a product. 

I also have a personal rule that all games I make must be fully playable with only a mouse, touchpad or touchscreen. This is because it allows me to make accessible games for people with motor disabilities to enjoy while keeping my development costs manageable as a small developer.

# Blog Schedule
I update a new [weekly recap](https://clementineaccount.github.io/posts/weekly-0-introduction/) post every Sunday, which is often a brief summary indicating that I am still alive and what I am working on. Beyond that, I also write post-mortems and tutorials based off the things I learned making at least one full, finished game a month.
