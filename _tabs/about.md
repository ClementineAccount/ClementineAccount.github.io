# Who am you? What is this site?

My name is Clementine, I was born in 1999 and I live in Singapore. In the past I used to update this blog least once a week to share my retrospective on the projects I have completed that week or occassionally things that I have learned that could be useful for others. It has seen been more on a hitatus as I focus on my full-time internship for SMRT.

One of the past projects was a focus on 'Game A Week' where I finish a playable video game prototype every week and described what I learned from it. I have yet to decide how I would like to pivot the content here. I still keep an active journal, so maybe I will use some of the notes there and repurpose them to create some useful articles for the public.

Beyond writing about my projects or things I learned relating to developing software, I tend to be a more 'private' person when it comes to an online presence and so I don't tend to write about my personal life in this blog.
